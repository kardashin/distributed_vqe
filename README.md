# Distributed VQE

This code simulates the variational quantum eigensolver executed on several devices.

To do:
- Implement summation of the cross-terms (instead of doing the kronecker multiplication).
- Think on how to avoid performing the Hadamard test for evaluating the cross-terms. 
- Check this: [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006125v5](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006125v5).
